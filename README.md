## Thesis: protest incidence in Cambodia
#### Model 1: Protestsi = β0 + β1urban + β2date + β3population + β4type + εi
  urban- dummy variable for urban area (urban=1, rural=0)

  date- election year or non-election year

  population- size of population of area

  type- associated actor/movement focus
 
The QoA dataset outlines the quality/intensity of authoritarian rule in Cambodia from 1975 to 2015. In tandem with ACLED data, I will analyze different factors to determine how trends affect protest incidence in Cambodia, specifically in pre and post-election years.
